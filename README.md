# AI-ethics-and-bias-research
This is my research article on AI bias and how to mitigate it. The study uses peer-reviewed research and experiments to prove that AI is inherently unbiased; rather, AI bias is a direct result of human oversight in data processing and algorithmic training. Also, human misuse of AI. 

Please check out the article and the abstract section for more details:

More Information:

Motivation:
- I wanted to understand AI more and the reasoning behind these discrepancies that arise from it.
- I am highly fascinated by AI, but I am vastly interested in the ethicality of AI in our modern world.
- For AI to coexist with humans, it has to be ethical and unbiased.
- Other than the AI bias, there are other concerns I am interested in, like AI's impact on the environment and users' safety with things like AI data collection.
- I would love to look further into those things, so the first step is this article above.
- I also want to look further into how AI is advancing so quickly and at what cost. It's also concerning how numerous articles online discuss the vast sums of money that big tech companies have invested in AI researchers.
- At what cost do these AI advancements come to our society? 
  
Evidence:
- My conclusion is backed by hours of researching peer-reviewed journals
- Most of the resources were found on UCSC's online library
- You can find all the resources on the references page
